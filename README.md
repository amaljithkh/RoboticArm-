# RoboticArm-
Here I am presenting a Robotic Arm project using Raspberry Pi 3, Python Code, 3D printed parts, 6 Hobby Servo motors, 5volt 2.5 Amp power supply and an Android App. specifically created to control the arm using ‘MIT App Inventor’ which is a great cloud based application to create Android apps for free. Project file for the app is also attached so that you can tailor the app to suit your needs and or learn to create new Android apps. Highlight of this project is Zero Jitter Servos, all servos are under perfect control.  
  
This Robotic Arm has 5 DOF (degrees of freedom) controlled by 5 servo motors plus a gripper powered by another servo motor. All parts including the Raspberry pi can be powered with a single 5 volt DC 2.5 amp power supply and does not need any additional boards (Arduino or so). If you have no access to a 3D printer, don’t worry, you may purchase a ready-made robotic arm online for a reasonable price (see link below). The Arm runs on code written in Python3 language. Just follow the steps described below and you would be having your very own Robotic Arm at your service I no time!
